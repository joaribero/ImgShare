New NodeJs webapp project. 

Little proyect of a social media web. With users who can upload pictures, write comments and like.

## FinalUpdate
I added some validations but there is still a long list of them to make. Some of them are really tedious and I don't think they fulfill the purpose of this project for me. Wich basically is learn the basics of NodeJs, Express and MongoDB.

That is why I'll probably not continue improving this project anymore in the future 

## To Test it:
1. Clone this repository locally.
2. You need to have a local mongoDB URI connection or one provided by MongoAtlas. Then replace the URI declared into (src/database) with yours. The one that figures already in the project will no longer work (safety reasons xD).
3. Position the console in the folder proyect and run the next commands:
    1. >npm install :all
    2. >npm start  
4. Go to >localhost:3000
